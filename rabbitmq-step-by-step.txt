RabbitMq Step by Step

Open an elevated command line (Run as Administrator)
Navigate to the sbin directory of the RabbitMQ Server installation directory. In my case the path is 

C:\Program Files (x86)\RabbitMQ Server\rabbitmq_server-3.3.4\sbin

Run the following command to enable the plugin
           ->  rabbitmq-plugins.bat enable rabbitmq_management
Then, re-install the RabbitMQ service using the commands below:
     -> rabbitmq-service.bat stop 
     -> rabbitmq-service.bat install 
     ->rabbitmq-service.bat start
	 
	 
	 To check if everything worked as expected, navigate to http://localhost:15672/mgmt. You will be prompted for username and password. The default credentials are:
Username: guest
Password: guest
